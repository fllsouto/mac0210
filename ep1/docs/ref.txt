This sort of behaviour, expanding a small area into a large one, is exactly the sort of behaviour we expect to give rise to self-similar fractals. So if we were to start a Newton-Raphson iteration at each point on the real line, run each iteration until it converged to within a given tolerance level of a root, and then colour the starting point according to which root it ended up at, we might well expect to see fractal shapes.
